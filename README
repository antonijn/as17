  BUILD & INSTALL

Run the following commands:

	make && sudo make install

You may optionally set PREFIX to a custom installation prefix:

	make && sudo make install PREFIX=/home/xxx/local

This also installs the man pages to PREFIX/share/man/man1. To rebuild the
man pages, run:

	make man

This requires the ronn program: https://github.com/rtomayko/ronn
