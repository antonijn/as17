AS17 -- ASSEMBLER FOR THE FICTIONAL RUN1617 CPU
===============================================

  BUILD & INSTALL

Run the following commands:

	make all && sudo make install

You may optionally set PREFIX to a custom installation prefix:

	make all && sudo make install PREFIX=/home/xxx/local

`make install` also installs the man pages to PREFIX/share/man/man1.

Note that `make all` requires the ronn program:

If you do not wish to build the man pages you can run `make release`
instead of `make all`.
